"Hi, folks --

I'm Ben (he/they). I oversee Talent Acquisition & Development for Storj Labs (decentralized cloud storage). Before that I was recruiting for Medici Ventures, the blockchain-focused subsidiary of Overstock.com. In short, I'm deeply imbedded in the blockchain and talent communities.

I graduated Valedictorian with a BS in Human Communication, emphasizing in Organizational Design & Leadership. I'm a staunch advocate for distributed and autonomous work.

Excited to be here. So much to learn!",True
