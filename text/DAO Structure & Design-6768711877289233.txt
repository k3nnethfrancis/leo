# DAO Structure & Design Project

The core objective of the DAO Structure & Design project is to create a well-researched body of knowledge about DAO structures & design. It is not an audit project about what exists, but more about how effective and impactful DAO structures should look likeThe DAO Structure & Design body of knowledge will help those who are thinking of building a DAO with guidance, and also those who are already running DAOs, in transforming or optimizing their DAO structures.

Project Stages There are three key stages of the project:Stage One (Currently Live): (1A) A literature review to assimilate and dissect existing knowledge around organization design, and how they have been applied to DAOs (1B) Audit of current DAO structures using public documentation(1C) Accompany audit with DAO Cartographer interviewsStage Two (to do): In-depth interviews with a representative set of builders, creators, community managers, and experts in the DAO ecosystemStage Three (to do): Release of the final findings report2. Approach1) The literature review is not aimed to be extensive but focused and pragmatic towards organizational structures and their impact and influence on DAO structure and design2) The number of in-depth interviews is the key component of the study, and we want to make this extensive, but not unmanageable. A total of 40-50 interviews are provisionally planned, and we might rationalize the figure based on the range of viewpoints these interviews will provide.Engagement plan:The purpose of the engagement plan is to:widen the reach of research outcomes so that these can be translated and applied in communitiesdevelop a network of people we can draw on for our research e.g. interview participantsmaximize the conversion of knowledge to financial value in our outputs contributing to TalentDAOs sustainability e.g. NFT marketingEngagement activities would be anchored to milestones such as the end or launch of a new Stage of work. Example activities:set up in-person and virtual events to celebrate the end of each stagepublicize remotely through networks but also at in-person eventscreate standalone materials like videos, summary reports, and blogs3. Stage One(1A) A literature review to assimilate and dissect existing knowledge around organization design, and how they have been applied to DAOs(1B) A DAO Structure AuditStage1A: Literature reviewObjectiveThe literature review needs to be detailed and pragmatic and focuses on covering: - key thinking and frameworks from traditional organization design - considers examples of transitioning of web2 organizational structures to web3, new and emerging org structures in web3 e.g. top 50 DAOs.  This and the audit in Stage 1b will inform the lens through which we conduct our interviews in Stage 2. QuestionsFor each publication
- What are the key organisational design principles that have been applied to DAOs in current thinking i.e. research and comment pieces?
- What types of research and publications are out there?
- What types of organisations are being studied?

Book referencesLiterature libraryPlease fill in the details of documents that need to be a part of the literature review in the table below (add rows as required). At this point, add only document names, links, and a synopsis if available. Add names of DAOs and other web3 collectives that warrant research. Outcome of Stage One:This framework will drive the shaping of Stage Two, and will also allow for an initial mapping of successful DAOs against this structure.Search TwoStage 1BIn addition to the literature review, a comprehensive DAO structural assessment needs to be conducted. This would entail identifying top DAOs (the criteria could be the number of active members etc) and creating a repository of each DAO’s structure (which is generally available in GitHub docs, SOBOL profiles, or via individual DAO cartographers)https://sobol.io/d/explore4. Stage Two: In-depth interviews with a representative set of builders, creators, community managers, and experts in the DAO ecosystemWe kick-off Stage Two simultaneously with Stage One, by identifying a list of names in the TradCo and web3 space who we can interview in-depth around DAO structures. This will be a combination of tapping into our personal networks and asking key people in TalentDAO for help and suggestions. We are aiming for around 40-50 interviews, which is extensive and rigorous, and so we need to be very selective of who we should be interviewing.Key interviewee qualification criteria - Should have the knowledge and experience of talking about org structures in web3, and what does or does not work for DAOs.I think 10-15 interviews per person involved in the project should be manageable. The more people interested in the project, the better. I would propose half-standardized interviews to have some sort of consistency and allow further evaluation of the collected data. We would need to decide on the methods of evaluation and transcription after the first stage is completed. This could be used to create at least one (if not two) academic papers if we want, I assume. Please fill in the initial list of names, and why they are a good fit for interviews in the table below:S.No.Name & RoleLink (Twitter bio)Why fit for an interview?Vitalik Buterin :)Mr.NobodytalentDAO & great knowledgeSaulthorin.ethtalentDAO & great knowledgek3nn.ethtalentDAO & great knowledgeGcal (Bankless)Active DAO contributor, leading role in BanklessRyan Sean AdamsBankless founderDavid HoffmannBankless founderBPetesSobol cofounderAlex WagnerSobolTracheopterixhttps://twitter.com/tracheopteryx?lang=enCo-founder CoordinapeOther Coordinape & Sobol founderKevin OwockiFounder GitcoinOther Gitcoin core team membersIdeas for interview questionsPotential perspectivesIt would be interesting to compare our audit with interviews: how much does work as prescribed compare to work as disclosed, and potentially from other or further research work as done - https://humanisticsystems.com/2016/12/05/the-varieties-of-human-work/5. Stage ThreeThere is interest to make the final findings report as an NFT, which will then be released with a specified number of copies, with a tagged price. The number of copies and the price will be decided at the time we are ready with the findings. If we go ahead with the idea of launching an NFT, there will be stage 4 of the project, which will be the NFT launch and marketing stage.Should we still evaluate the idea of outlining the overall project and applying for grants? I assume this would allow more people to contribute and the overall level of participation would be higher.OtherMeeting ActionsCommon DAO DefinitionsAlthough it might not be directly in line with the upcoming tasks, I researched common DAO definitions to have a starting point (introduction) and initial analysis: Noteworthy definitions (not an exhaustive list):“The ideal of a decentralized autonomous organization is easy to describe: it is an entity that lives on the internet and exists autonomously, but also heavily relies on hiring individuals to perform certain tasks that the automaton itself cannot do.”~Vitalik Buterin, DAOs, DACs, DAs and More: An incomplete Terminology Guide“The general concept of a "decentralized organization" is that of a virtual entity that has a certain set of members or shareholders which, perhaps with a 67% majority, have the right to spend the entity's funds and modify its code. The members would collectively decide on how the organization should allocate its funds.”~Ethereum Whitepaper“(…)a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which is a term used to describe a “virtual” organization embodied in computer code and executed on a distributed ledger or blockchain.”~Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO (SEC as a reaction of “The DAO” in 2017 and an example of a national state institution defining DAOs)“Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are entities that leverage blockchains, digital assets and related technologies to deploy resources, coordinate activities and make decisions. DAOs attempt to decentralize the operation of firms and other collective entities by making functional and financial information transparent and empowering token-holding members to propose, vote on and enact changes”~WEF, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations: Beyond the Hype (2022). (One of the most recent definitions of DAOs by a global institution)“A DAO is a blockchain-based system that enables people to coordinate and governthemselves mediated by a set of self-executing rules deployed on a publicblockchain, and whose governance is decentralized (i.e., independent from centralcontrol).”~Hassan, S. & De Filippi, P. (2021). Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Internet Policy Review, 10(2). https://doi.org/10.14763/2021.2.1556 (One of the most common cited scientific definitions)“A DAO is a system in which storage and transaction of value and notary (voting) functions can be designed, organized, recorded, and archived and where data and actions are recorded and autonomously executed in a decentralized way”.~Rikken, Olivier and Janssen, Marijn and Kwee, Zenlin, The Ins and Outs of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (Daos).
