    Decentralized Leadership StudyPrincipal Researchers:  (qualitative researcher - grounded theory)Mr.Nobody (quantitative researcher - meta-analyses/systematic reviews) (qualitative researcher - anthropological focus)PurposeDecentralization is not just about tech and information - it's also about distributing power and authority in our organizations. Sharing leadership is a key tenet of DAOs. Yet distributing leadership across members of a community is easier said than done: there are several instances of centralized leadership within the web3 ecosystem. For this reason, there is a need to study leadership that enables building effective collaborative communities by investigating asymmetries of power, information, relationships, skills, reputation, money, and time. Goals and Key-OutcomesA point-of-view publication via Mirror based on secondary research about shared/distributed/decentralized/collective leadership practices informing qualitative-quantitative research questions for primary research.Evidence-based practices for DAOs on how to grow shared leadership to achieve a fair degree of decentralization, community involvement, and collective ownership. A peer-reviewed journal publication legitimizing DAO research and pioneering decentralized leadership in this emergent ecosystem.A practical guide for people shifting leadership mindset from Web2 context to Web3.StatusPhase 1: Rapid review on leadershipPhase 2: Point-Of-View Mirror PublicationPhase 3: DAOs specific literature reviewPhase 4: Qualitative primary research - in-depth interviewsPhase 5: Rigorous coding and analysisPhase 6: Initial findings & community feedbackPhase 7: Findings reportedPhase 8: Publication Draft #1Phase 9: Publication Draft #nPhase 10: Final Publication uploaded into the Journal of Decentralized Work Project SpecsStudy DesignsStudy 1Rapid review on leadership research (among which shared, distributed, collective leadership models, etc.) along with reviewing any existing thinking on leadership within DAOs (used to formulate research questions).Study 2Primary qualitative research using in-depth interviews for a grounded theory study on DAO leadershipStudy 3Proposed primary quantitative research using survey design and/or experimental designsStudy #1: Rapid ReviewAs the first step of our research we conduct a rapid review of the available leadership literature (secondary research). A rapid review aims to answer clearly defined questions with the best available evidence defined through explicit criteria. These include:Scholarly journals, peer-reviewedAvailable through ABI/INFORM Global, Business Source Premier, PsychINFO databasesLimited to meta-analyses and systematic reviewsPublished in the past 25 yearsArticles published in EnglishMeta-analyses and systematic reviews synthesize the whole body of research on a topic up to a specific date. Starting from this type of publication ensures we leverage available valid knowledge on the topic of leadership to inform (primary) quali-quantitative field research within DAOs. Research questionsThe questions we aim to answer are the following:What are the most relevant theories about leadership effectiveness?What do we know about their predictive validity over individual, team, organizational outcomes?How can we measure different leadership dimensions/constructs?Data extraction From each study we report in the form of a clearly structured table [see example of matrix for meta-analyses and systematic reviews ] any information relevant to the rapid review questions, such as year of publication, research design, sample size, population (e.g., industry, type of employees), outcome measures, possible moderators or mediators, main findings, effect sizes with a 95% confidence interval, limitations.Guidelines on Effect sizesAn outcome can be statistically significant but not practically relevant. Even a trivial effect can be statistically significant if the sample size is large. Contrarily, even a large, practical relevant effect can be statistically non-significant if the sample size is small. Also, p-values do NOT measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone (Ziliak, 2016). Nor can a p-value tell you the size of an effect, the strength of the evidence or the importance of a result. For this reason, instead of assessing p-values we look at ‘effect size’ – a standard measure of the magnitude of the effect – of the studies included when addressing impact questions.To determine the magnitude of an effect, apply Cohen’s rules of thumb (Cohen, 1988; see below). According to Cohen a ‘small’ effect is an effect that is only visible through careful examination. A ‘medium’ effect, however, is one that is ‘visible to the naked eye of the careful observer’. Finally, a ‘large’ effect is one that anybody can easily see because it is substantial.                       Source: CEBMa Guidelines for REAs in Management and OrganizationsNote that Cohen’s rules of thumb are for many reasons arbitrary (Cooper & Lindsay, 1998). A standard mean difference of .20 may be regarded as ‘small’ when the outcome concerns job satisfaction but ‘large’ when the outcome concerns fatal medical errors. When assessing impact, it is therefore important to relate the effect size directly to the outcome measured.Study #2: Qualitative researchAs the second step of our research we conduct primary qualitative research using in-depth intense interviews for a grounded theory study on decentralized leadership. The goal was to interview people who could help us explore what is leadership in DAOs, which initially consisted of people who:have significant experience in DAOs (over 6+ months in a role with DAO accountabilities)typical roles include founder, community manager, governance or operations leadsCheck out our chronological process and milestones for the work already completed.Research questionsThe questions we aim to answer are the following:tldr: what is leadership in DAOs?How do leadership principles, practices and behaviors apply in the context of decentralized work? Specifically, How are people coming to and developing their leadership in DAOs?What are the pitfalls to avoid when leading in DAOs?What helps facilitate effective leadership at the individual and systematic level of DAOs?Data collectionData was collected through intense interviewing for 60-minute sessions over Zoom. Participants had the option to have video on or off. All sessions were recorded and transcribed using otter.ai.Interview Questions:1) Briefly describe your role in your DAO. (any other DAOs or roles worth mentioning?) 2) Tell me about how you first came to engage in a DAO. 3) What is leadership in DAOs? (your take on our primary question)4) Tell me about when you first felt you were leading within the DAO. 5) How did you pursue developing yourself as a DAO leader? 6) Describe what you believe is personally needed to lead in a DAO context? 7) Describe what you believe is needed within the DAO to enable people to take the lead? 8) What would you tell someone are the pitfalls or things to avoid when leading in DAOs? (share an example of a fail or mistake you’ve made.) 9) What do you believe are the most important ways to actively develop leadership within DAOs? 10) Describe how your thinking on DAO leadership has evolved, or not, with experience. 11) What advice would you give to someone that decided they would like to pursue DAO leadership? 12) Lastly, is there anything else you would like to share?DAO experiences represented: ConstitutionDAO, MolochDAO, RaidGuild, MetaCartel, DAOHaus, BANKLESS, GitcoinDAO, Yearn, UMA, Bright Moments DAO, ApeSwap, Giveth, Aragon, The Commons Stack, Mega Gamma Delta, Seed Club, AndinoDAO, CabinDAO, Blu3 DAO, Token Engineering Commons, RnDAO, LabDAO, MirrorDAO, PolygonDAO, Lobby3, NewAtlantisDAO, talentDAO, Coordinape, MoonDAO, Wonderverse, and DreamDAO (among others).Data analysisData was analyzed using constant comparative method used in grounded theory research approaches. Memos, interview data, and secondary sets of data are used to build a theoretical framework from the ground up.Interview transcripts were scrubbed/corrected for accuracyThree rounds of coding conducted for analysisinitial thematic coding and memos (these are our initial notes during/post data collection)line-by-line and in vivo coding (we focus on gerunds and use participants words)focused, then theoretical coding (we code the codes and develop a theoretical framework)Member checkingFindings and implications for future research and practice
