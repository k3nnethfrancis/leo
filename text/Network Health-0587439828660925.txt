    PI:  ; This study is currently on Phase 2.Quick links:OverviewDecentralized organizations eliminate hierarchy and empower an autonomous workforce to achieve the goals of the network with distributed discretion. To better understand the health of such adaptive systems, we can leverage a network approach to organizational analysis.There are several indicators of healthy organizations that can be observed in their network structure. In decentralized organizations we have the opportunity to analyze more of this data than ever before. Governance processes and other on-chain activity are on the public ledger and Discord communication data is extractable with an API. As we can begin to see with products like DAODash, we now have the opportunity to bridge these data sources to extract insights about organizations that we previously could not.But communication and on-chain activity still do not tell the complete picture of what is happening under the hood. We must also extract data on the psychosocial properties of the organization in order to have a complete understanding of the health of a DAO.The first step in achieving this is designing a psychometric instrument for extracting the attitudes and perceptions of contributors that make up the psychosocial properties of the organization.The second step of this effort will require data collection from various DAOs willing to participate in our research. We will need to extract governance and other on-chain activity, communication, and psychometric data to analyze DAO network structures and correlate them with their performance. By doing so, we can uncover the global optima of efficiency for which DAOs can model. The idea is that using the metrics we ultimately deem important, DAOs can find their own local optimal to achieve organizational effectiveness in their domain.Our ultimate goal in doing this is to see the DAO ecosystem thrive, so they may blossom into healthy, high functioning, sustainable organizational networks that can employ a workforce large enough to achieve our vision of enabling 1 billion people to have access to alternative work arrangements.Lets DAO it.
